# Breaking Barriers: A Case Study on Coinbase's Role in Driving Cryptocurrencies Forward

## Overview and Origin
Coinbase is a digital currency exchange platform founded in October 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. The company's primary mission is to create an open financial system consisting of the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Solana, and Etherium. At the time of 2012, buying and selling cryptos required the use of complex technical systems that took a lot of understanding to operate. Armstrong and Ehrsam recognized the need to provide a user-friendly platform that would make the process simple for the common consumer. When the initial version of Coinbase was launched, users were able to purchase Bitcoin through their credit cards and bank accounts to be stored in a secure online wallet. Coinbase has since grown significiantly by offering more cryptocurrencies on their platform, as well as introducing a wide array of trading platforms, such as Coinbase Pro, and merchant services, such as Coinbase Commerce. Coinbase has received funding from many sources throughout its history, including private equity firms and venture capitalists. In May 2013, Coinbase received its first $5 million Series A investment from Union Square Ventures. This investment helped the company kickstart its adoption of more coins to be traded on the platform. In 2017, the company raised over $100 million in a Series D funding round led by Venture Partners, with participation from Battery Ventures and Draper Associates. The company then went on to raise $300 million in a Series E funding round, led by investment firm Tiger Global Management in 2018. In April 2021, Coinbase went public on the NASDAQ, becoming the first major cryptocurrency exchange to release an IPO. Overall, Coinbase has amassed over $500 million in funding from a large number of investors, and its widespread adoption has made it the most famous cryptocurrency industry in the world.
